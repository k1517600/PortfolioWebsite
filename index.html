            Hi! Thanks so much for visiting my <i>website</i>!!! :D
        </p>
        <p>
            This is where I host all of my projects. If you're here for the ID Generator, you can click the big "Projects" button at the top of the screen and look through there.
            If you're here otherwise, wow! I'm flattered. I'm glad you want to know a bit about me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am Joshua Novak, an aspiring Computer Science major local to texas. I've spent 14 or so years of my life learning to program and it's just now starting to pay off.
            Some CS stuff I've done:
            <p>
                - This website
                - Made a few games (CS3, CS4, Flappy Battle)
                - Make applications for my and other people's convenience (JHS ID Generator, Blamazon Reverb)
                - Played a lot of videogames (it's a crippling issue)
            </p>
